# Resume Database Extension: Education and Institutions Management

## Project Overview

This project extends a simple resume database application to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for an `Education` table that maintains a many-to-one relationship with a `Profile` table and a many-to-many relationship with an `Institution` table. A key feature of this assignment is the integration of a jQuery autocomplete field in the user interface to enhance the experience of entering the name of educational institutions.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Implement CRUD operations for managing educational background associated with user profiles.
- **Database Relationships:** Manage complex relationships between profiles, educational records, and institutions.
- **jQuery Autocomplete:** Utilize jQuery autocomplete for efficient and user-friendly entry of institution names.
- **Responsive UI:** Enhance user interface for adding, viewing, and editing education and institution information.

# PHP Projects Collection

Welcome to my PHP Projects Collection repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing a variety of projects I've developed using PHP, one of the most popular server-side scripting languages designed for web development. From simple scripts to complex web applications, this repository serves as a portfolio of my work and experiments with PHP.
